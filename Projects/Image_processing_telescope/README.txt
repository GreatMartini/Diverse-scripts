This is a project realised at the Astrophysics' Institute of Paris. The project was the observation of the Orion Nebula with the IAP's telescope and the image processing of the observation. The python code was written to process the image data nevertheless, the taken photographies were of poot resulation due to polution from the sky. In this context, the python code was not able to correctly superpose the images and the final processing was realised with the Siril software.
