This directory contains part of the work that I realised for my second year of master's degree internship. The work consisted in programing the Einstein equations in a AMR code generator called Simflowny. The .yaml files are the documents needed to generate the code. The file Einstein.yaml contains all the numerical relativity equations and the quantities needed for their calculation. The file Brill.yaml contains the Brill waves initial problem for the resolution of the Einstein equations. The Brill_external directory contains the generated code that must be run with the SAMRAI library. In that directory phi.h5 containt the initial conformal factor data. Since Simflowny is not able to solve elliptical equations for the initial conformal factor data, the initial data is calculated with the axisymmetrical "Ollin" code developed by Miguel Alcubierre. In this case, the axisymmetrical initial data was transformed to a 3-dimensional initial data with the ad-hoc code "transform.py". The transformation is poor since the code preserves cartesian symmetry while reflecting and rotating the data. A more general and advanced version of the transformation code was proposed but could not be implemented due to lack of time. Finally, the doc directory contains a tex file that aimed to explain how to use the code to future fellow interns at ICN institute.
